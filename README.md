# ðŸŸ¢ GitHub Contribution Art â€“ "HIRE ME"

This repository uses commit history to render a visual message â€” "HIRE ME" â€” in my GitHub contributions graph.

##  How It Works
The layout was generated using [Gitfiti](https://github.com/gelstudios/gitfiti), a Python tool that creates pixel-style text art on GitHub by making backdated commits.

## âš  Disclaimer
Most of my real work is in private/internal repos. This is a creative experiment to display a custom message. I'm planning to contribute more to open-source going forward.

##  Want to Make Your Own?
Clone the [Gitfiti repo](https://github.com/gelstudios/gitfiti) and run:

```bash
python gitfiti.py --message "HIRE ME" --name "Your Name" --email "email@example.com" --repo your-repo-path
```

Requires Python 3 and Git
