# 🟩 Green Contributions (Visual Only)

This repository is part of a personal experiment to create a fully green GitHub contributions graph. It uses backdated commits to simulate daily contributions from 2023 to the present.

## 📈 What This Is
A Python script makes multiple commits per day to generate a full contribution grid on my GitHub profile. It's not meant to reflect real open source activity.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
Most of my real work has been in private/internal repos since entering the industry. The green graph here is from a personal experiment. I plan to contribute more to open source and share more public work going forward.

## 🛠️ How It Works
The script:
- Loops through each day from Jan 1, 2023 to 2024
- Makes 5 commits per day to a simple text file
- Sets the commit date manually to match each day

## 🚀 How to Run It Yourself

```bash
git clone <repo>
cd green-contributions
python fill_contributions.py
git push origin main
```
